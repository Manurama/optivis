# Optivis #
Script to visualise optical environments. Uses the fantastic SVG optical components created by Alexander Franzen (http://www.gwoptics.org/ComponentLibrary/).  

## Requirements ##
Optivis requires the following components:

* Python 2.7+
* python-qt4

On Ubuntu/Debian you should be able to install these with the following command:

`~$ sudo apt-get install python python-qt4`

## Coordinate System ##
Optivis uses a left-handed coordinate system in line with almost all computer graphics applications. Positive angle rotations are clockwise.
